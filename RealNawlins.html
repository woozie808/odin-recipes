    <h1>Real N'awlins Muffuletta</h1>
    <p>A genuine muffuletta should be made on oven-fresh round Italian bread loves topped with sesame seeds. The spicy, tangy olive salad is what really sets this meat and cheese sandwich apart. These gigantic sandwiches were invented a century ago at Sicilian Deli here in New Orleans. Be sure to use high-quality ingredients as it really makes a difference!</p>

      <li>1 cup pimento-stuffed green olives, crushed</li>
      <li>½ cup drained kalamata olives, crushed</li>
      <li>½ cup pepperoncini, drained</li>
      <li>¼ cup roughly chopped pickled cauliflower florets</li>
      <li>¼ cup marinated cocktail onions</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons drained capers</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped celery</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped carrot</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon celery seed</li>
      <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>
      <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sandwiches:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (1 pound) loaves Italian bread</li>
      <li>8 ounces thinly sliced Genoa salami</li>
      <li>8 ounces thinly sliced cooked ham</li>
      <li>8 ounces thinly sliced cooked ham</li>
      <li>8 ounces sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>8 ounces sliced provolone cheese</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>To make the olive salad: Roughly chop together green olives, Kalamata olives, pepperoncini, cauliflower, cocktail onions, garlic, capers, celery, and carrot.</li>
      <li>Combine with oregano, basil, black pepper, and celery seed in a medium bowl. Add in olive oil, canola oil, and vinegar. Mix together and transfer the mixture into a glass jar (or other nonreactive container). Pour in more oil to cover if needed.</li>
      <li>Cover jar or container and refrigerate at least 8 hours to overnight.</li>
      <li>To make the sandwiches: Cut loaves of bread in half horizontally; hollow out some of the excess bread to make room for filling.</li>
      <li>Spread each piece of bread with equal amounts of the olive salad, including oil.</li>
      <li>Layer bottom half of each loaf with 1/2 of the salami, ham, mortadella, mozzarella, and Provolone slices.</li>
      <li>Replace top half on each loaf and cut the sandwiches into quarters.</li>
      <li>Serve immediately, or wrap tightly and refrigerate for a few hours; this will allow for the flavors to mingle and the olive salad to soak into the bread.</li>
    </ol>
